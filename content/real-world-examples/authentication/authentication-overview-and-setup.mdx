# Authentication Overview & Setup

In this section, we will be discussing the various tests located within the **cypress/tests/ui/auth.spec.ts** file.

Let's break down what is happening within the `beforeEach()` as it is important to understand what is going on since this hook is running before each test.

## beforeEach()

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.task("db:seed")

  cy.intercept("POST", "/users").as("signup")
  cy.intercept("POST", apiGraphQL, (req) => {
    const { body } = req

    if (
      body.hasOwnProperty("operationName") &&
      body.operationName === "CreateBankAccount"
    ) {
      req.alias = "gqlCreateBankAccountMutation"
    }
  })
})
```

You can find out more information about the custom Cypress commands used [here](/real-world-examples/custom-cypress-commands).

The first thing that happens inside of this hook is a custom task we have created called `db:seed` which is responsible for seeding our database.

```js
cy.task("db:seed")
```

Next, we are using <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" /> to intercept every **POST** request to the **/users** route. We are then aliasing this intercept to "signup." When you see `@signup` being used within a test, it is referring to this intercept.

```js
cy.intercept("POST", "/users").as("signup")
```

Finally, we are using <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" /> to intercept every **POST** request to our GraphQL API endpoint. Within the body of this intercept, we have a conditional to check to see if the GraphQL `operationName` is equal to "CreateBankAccount," if so, we are creating an alias to this intercept as `gqlCreateBankAccountMutation` . When you see `@gqlCreateBankAccountMutation` being used within a test, it is referring to this intercept.
