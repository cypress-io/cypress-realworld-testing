# User Settings Overview & Setup

![](/images/real-world-examples/user-settings/user-settings-overview-and-setup/Screen_Shot_2021-06-29_at_9.51.44_AM.png)

In this section, we will be discussing the various tests located within the **cypress/tests/ui/user-settings.spec.ts** file.

Let's breakdown what is happening within the `beforeEach()` as it is important to understand what is going on since this hook is running before each test.

## beforeEach()

```js
beforeEach(function () {
  cy.task("db:seed")

  cy.intercept("PATCH", "/users/*").as("updateUser")
  cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications*").as("getNotifications")

  cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
    cy.loginByXstate(user.username)
  })

  if (isMobile()) {
    cy.getBySel("sidenav-toggle").click()
  }

  cy.getBySel("sidenav-user-settings").click()
})
```

You can find out more information about the custom Cypress commands used [here](/real-world-examples/custom-cypress-commands).

The first thing we are doing is seeding our database using a custom Cypress task.

```js
cy.task("db:seed")
```

Next, we are using <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" /> to intercept every **PATCH** request to the **/users/\*** route. We are then aliasing this intercept to "updateUser." When you see `@updateUser` being used within a test, it is referring to this intercept.

```js
cy.intercept("PATCH", "/users/*").as("updateUser")
```

We are also intercepting any **GET** request to the **/notifications** route and aliasing the intercept to "getNotifications." When you see `@getNotifications` being used within a test, it is referring to this intercept.

```js
cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications*").as("getNotifications")
```

We then use a custom Cypress command `cy.database()` to query our database for our users. Then we use another custom Cypress command `cy.loginByXstate()` to login into the application using one of the users returned from `cy.database()`.

You can find out how these custom Commands work in greater detail [here](/real-world-examples/custom-cypress-commands).

```js
cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
  cy.loginByXstate(user.username)
})
```

Finally, we click the button to open the user settings window. We have a special utility function to determine if we are simulating a mobile device or not. You can find out how the `isMobile()` function works in greater detail [here](/real-world-examples/custom-cypress-commands).

```js
if (isMobile()) {
  cy.getBySel("sidenav-toggle").click()
}

cy.getBySel("sidenav-user-settings").click()
```
