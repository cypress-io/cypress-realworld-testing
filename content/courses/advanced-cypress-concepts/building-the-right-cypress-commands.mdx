# Building the right Cypress Commands

[Cypress commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) allow you to create custom functionality and even overwrite existing commands. Having this flexibility is incredibly convenient and powerful, but developers often struggle with when to write custom commands. A helpful thing to think about when you should write your custom command is _when your test code forces you to do so_. What exactly does this mean?

When you begin to notice yourself writing the same functionality over and over again, aka repeating yourself, across multiple tests, that is usually a good sign to make a custom command. Don't begin writing your tests by thinking in abstractions, i.e., custom commands—rather **abstract custom commands from your tests**.

You already do this all the time as a JavaScript developer each time you create a custom function in your code. Typically you will create a custom JS function to abstract some functionality to re-use within your application, i.e., utility functions. Cypress commands are the same thing. They allow you to re-use functionality across multiple tests.

## Creating a Custom Command

Let's take a look an example.

```js
cy.get('[data-test="signup-first-name"]').type("Bob")
cy.get('[data-test="signup-last-name"]').type("Ross")
cy.get('[data-test="signup-username"]').type("PainterJoy90")
cy.get('[data-test="signup-password"]').type("s3cret")
cy.get('[data-test="signup-confirmPassword"]').type("s3cret")
```

In this example, we are selecting several elements that all have a **data-test** attribute. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this syntax, it is quite a bit verbose. We could clean this up quite a bit and simplify things by creating our own custom command.

Instead of writing all of the above, it would be nice to write.

```js
cy.getBySel("signup-first-name").type("Bob")
cy.getBySel("signup-last-name").type("Ross")
cy.getBySel("signup-username").type("PainterJoy90")
cy.getBySel("signup-password").type("s3cret")
cy.getBySel("signup-confirmPassword").type("s3cret")
```

Let's see how to create the custom command `cy.getBySel()`. You can create your own custom commands by placing them inside of **cypress/support/commands.js**.

Here is what the `cy.getBysel()` looks like:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add("getBySel", (selector, ...args) => {
  return cy.get(`[data-test=${selector}]`, ...args)
})
```

As you can see, our custom command is a simple wrapper around `cy.get()`. This way, we can pass in the string contained within the **data-test** attribute, and our custom command will return the element.

## Another Custom Command Example

Let's take a look at another example. Let's say you need to log in as a user before each test. You can create a custom command that handles all of the logging in and authentication logic, so you can simply call it within your test.

```js
Cypress.Commands.add("loginByApi", (username, password) => {
  return cy.request("POST", `http://localhost:3000/login`, {
    username,
    password,
  })
})
```

In this example, we use a custom command called `cy.loginByApi()`, which accepts a username and password and then sends a post request to our API login route. Now within our tests, we can call this command, passing in a username and password.

```js
describe("POST /login", function () {
  it("login as user", function () {
    cy.loginByApi("jdoe", "password123").then((response) => {
      expect(response.status).to.eq(200)
    })
  })
})
```
