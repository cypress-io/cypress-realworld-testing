# Intercepting Network Requests

Knowing how to test network requests and responses is important for every web application. In this lesson you will learn how to use <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" /> to manipulate and test network requests and responses.

### Intercepting Server Requests

The most basic way to intercept a server request is as follows:

```js
cy.intercept("POST", "/users")
```

In this example we are intercepting any **POST** request to the **/users** route. Typically you will also **alias** an intercept to perform additional actions, like waiting, later in your test(s).

We explain how waiting works in the [Waiting & Retry-ability](/cypress-fundamentals/waiting-and-retry-ability) lesson.

```js
cy.intercept("POST", "/users").as("signup")

// ...

cy.wait("@signup")
```

### Overriding an existing intercept

Sometimes you may need to override and already existing intercept by using a **fixture** to **mock** the response data. Let's look at an example from the [Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/cypress/tests/ui/transaction-feeds.spec.ts).

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // ...

  cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions")

  // ...
})
```

In this example, we intercept any **GET** request to any route that matches **/transactions/public\***. We are doing this in a `beforeEach()`, which means this intercept will run before every test.

Later on, in one of our tests, we use <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" /> to intercept and override this same **GET** and route but using a [fixture](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests#Fixtures) to mock the response.

```js
cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*", {
  // ...
  fixture: "public-transactions.json",
}).as("mockedPublicTransactions")
```

So as you can see, we can also intercept other intercepts and then provide mocked data using a **fixture**. We alias this intercept override as **mockedPublicTransactions**.

### Changing Headers

You can also use <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" /> to modify headers from a response.

```js
cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*", {
  headers: {
    "X-Powered-By": "Express",
    Date: new Date().toString(),
  },
})
```

In this example we are dynamically modifying the Date header and also adding a new header `"X-Powered-By": "Express"`.

The original headers from the response will remain intact. These new headers are appended to the original ones.

### Modifying Response Data

Sometimes you will need to modify a portion of the response data while leaving everything else intact.

```js
cy.intercept("POST", "/bankaccounts", (req) => {
  const { body } = req
  req.continue((res) => {
    res.body.data.listBankAccount = []
  })
})
```

In this example, we are overriding the `listBankAccount` property and setting it to be an empty array. We need to use [.continue()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept#Controlling-the-outbound-request-with-req-continue) to modify the response data.

### Inspecting a Request

You can also use intercept to inspect a request, in the callback passed to <apiLink apiName="intercept" displayName="cy.intercept()" />.

```js
cy.intercept("POST", apiGraphQL, (req) => {
  const { body } = req

  if (
    body.hasOwnProperty("operationName") &&
    body.operationName === "CreateBankAccount"
  ) {
    req.alias = "gqlCreateBankAccountMutation"
  }
})
```

In this example, we are using intercept to inspect a GraphQL query to determine what kind of query it is. If the query is `CreateBankAccount` then we are setting its alias to `gqlCreateBankAccountMutation`

## Practice

If you would like to practice intercepting Network Requests and working with the Network in general with Cypress, we have created a special repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-blog). The installation instructions are located in the **README.md** file.

The practice file you are looking for can be found in **cypress/integration/Practice/network-requests.spec.js**.

Should you get stuck or need some help, all of the answers are provided within **cypress/integration/Answers/network-requests.spec.js**
