# Using Data to Build Dynamic Tests

In the lesson [Database Initialization & Seeding](/advanced-cypress-concepts/database-initialization-and-seeding), we give you several strategies for creating the data necessary for your tests. In this lesson, we will help you better understand how to use that data to drive your tests.

## What are Data-Driven Tests?

When we speak of "Data-Driven Tests," we refer to using variables, fixtures, or data from a database to construct all aspects of a dynamic test (UI interactions, expectations, and the test itself).

For example, let's say you have a test which tests the login form in your app. You could hard code the data, like so:

```js
cy.get("username").type("jdoe")
cy.get("password").type("password123")
```

Or you could use data from variables.

```js
const users = [
  {
    username: "John",
    password: "password123",
  },
  {
    username: "Jane",
    password: "password123",
  },
]

cy.get("username").type(users[0].username)
cy.get("password").type(users[0].password)
```

You could also use data from a [fixture](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture).

```js
cy.fixture("users.json").as("usersData")

cy.get("username").type(usersData[0].username)
cy.get("password").type(usersData[0].password)
```

Or, you could use an actual user from your database.

## Using data from remote systems (API, database, etc.) to drive seed data and tests

```js
describe("Notifications", () => {
  const ctx = {}

  beforeEach(() => {
    // ...

    cy.database("filter", "users").then((users) => {
      ctx.userA = users[0]
      ctx.userB = users[1]
      ctx.userC = users[2]
    })
  })

  it("allows users to login", () => {
    cy.get("username").type(ctx.userA.userName)
    cy.get("password").type(ctx.userA.password)
  })
})
```

In this example, `cy.database()` is a custom Cypress command which performs operations on our database depending upon which arguments are passed into it. You can learn how this command works [here](/real-world-examples/custom-cypress-commands#cydatabase).

## Benefits of Data-Driven Tests

Using actual data has several benefits. First, you are using existing data from your application. This more closely mimics how real users interact with your app. Hard-coded data can be challenging to maintain over time, as it requires consistent updating and maintenance. Instead of hard-coded data, the only thing you have to maintain is the data itself.
