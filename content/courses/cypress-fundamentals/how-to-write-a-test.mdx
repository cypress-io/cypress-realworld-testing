# How to Write a Test

When first learning how to write automated tests, it can be easy to get stuck not knowing how to write the test. Tests should be composed using a pattern that makes them easy to write, reason about, and expand. One pattern is the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern, which encourages the organization of the test code in a way that allows the most readability and flexibility.

In step one, the **Arrange** step, you have to perform some setup for your test. For example, in the case of a Cypress end-to-end test, you need to tell Cypress to open the browser and navigate to the correct URL.

```js
cy.visit("http://localhost:8888")
```

In step two, the **Act** step, you perform some action. For example, in the case of a todo app, you want to test that you can add a single todo.

```js
cy.get(".new-todo").type("Buy Milk{enter}")
```

In this example, we are getting the element with the class of **.new-todo** and then typing "Buy Milk" and simulating pressing the **Enter** key to add the todo.

Finally, in step three, you **Assert**. In this step, you assert that the thing you acted upon in step two did what you expected.

```js
cy.get(".todo-list li").should("have.length", 1)
```

In this example, we are getting the element that contains the todo items that we added to the app and asserting that there is only a single todo.

With these three steps in mind, here is what a simple Cypress end-to-end test looks like for a TodoMVC application.

## A simple end-to-end test

The following example is from the [React TodoMVC app](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc):

```js
// app.spec.js

describe("React TodoMVC", () => {
  it("adds a single todo", () => {
    cy.visit("http://localhost:8888") // Arrange
    cy.get(".new-todo").type("Buy Milk{enter}") // Act
    cy.get(".todo-list li").should("have.length", 1) // Assert
  })
})
```

Before breaking this test file down, it is important to note that Cypress is built upon [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). In this example, all of the functions other than those that begin with `cy` come from Mocha.

Each test file will typically begin with a `describe()` function or "block." This function provides a way to organize your tests and makes things easier to read. Test files can have multiple `describe()` within them as it provides the context for the tests written inside them.

Next, we have an `it` block. This is our actual test and where our test code goes. We first provide a test name "adds a single todo" and then pass in a callback function. Within the body of our test, we are doing three things.

### 1. Arrange

Telling Cypress to visit the URL **http://localhost:8888**

### 2. Act

Getting the element with the class of **.new-todo** and typing in the string "Buy Milk" and pressing the **Enter** key.

### 3. Assert

We are asserting that only a single todo has been added to the app.
